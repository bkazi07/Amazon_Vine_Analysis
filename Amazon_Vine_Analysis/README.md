# Module 16 Challenge

# Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:

The purpose of this challenge was to analyze Amazon reviews written by the members of the Amazon Vine program that is a program that pays for reviews being made. Spark and AWS would be used for this analysis. The ETL process would be performed in the cloud and the DataFrame would then be uploaded to an RDS. The transformed data would then be loaded into pgAdmin. The second goals of the challenge would be to use PySpark to perform statistical analysis of data. Then it would be determined if there was any bias from the vine members in the market that was selected. 
# Results
The results will be provided for the following three below:
1.  Numbers of Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews
2.  Numbers Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews for 5 stars
3.  Percentage of Vine reviews and non Vine reviews for 5 stars

# Summary:
There might have been a positivity bias that was present and uncovered through the analysis. It was seen that the unpaid vine reviewers had significantly higher instances of a 5 star review made on products. It could be seen that the paid vine reviewers had a very low percent of 5 star reviews made.
